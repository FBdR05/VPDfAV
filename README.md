# VPSfAV
A Computational Tool To Aid The Teaching Of Protection Systems


VPSfAV is capable of verifying over current protection schemes in radial systems, common in distribution. This computational tool was
designed to provide students a simple and visual program capable of verifying protection scheme project, and to encourage students 
to develop their own programs. VPSfAV was developed in Visual Basic for Applications, in Excel.
